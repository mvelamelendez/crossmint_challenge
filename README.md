# crossmint_challenge

This repository contains the solution I designed for the Crossmint coding challenge.

I decided to work with HTML and Javascript. Specifically, I used the FETCH API. 

I created a JS file for each of the possible astral objects. 

## How to run the code
To run the code, we must open the "index.html" file in a browser.
Then, to create the required Megaverse, we must click on the "Draw Megaverse" button. When the Megaverse is finished, an alert will indicate it.
To restart the Megaverse to its original value, we must click on the "Restart Megaverse" button. When it is finished, an alert will indicate it.

The process could be completely automatized by uncommenting line 108. 
I chose the button approach because I thought it could be a different solution.

To test the code, I used the "Live Server" extension in VSCode.

I have uploaded a folder that contains all the necessary files. Those files have also been uploaded to:
